# Contribution Guide

## Workflow - Mainline Branching Model

We use a **Mainline (Trunk-Based) Development** model with short-lived feature branches. This choice supports our team size (4-5 developers), fast CI feedback (<5 minutes), and weekly release cadence. All development happens in feature branches off `main`, with features toggled until complete.

### Branch Naming
- `feature/issue-123-short-desc`
- `bugfix/issue-456-fix-typo`
- `hotfix/critical-security-patch`

### Commit Style
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Example: `feat(auth): add MFA support`

### Review SLA
- First response within 24 hours
- Complete review within 48 hours
- Use @mentions for urgent reviews

### Merge Policy
- Squash merge for feature branches
- Required: 1 approval + green CI
- PR size: ≤300 LOC (split if larger)
